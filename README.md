# Realtime Raytracing

An experiment with C++, SDL2 and OpenMP-based realtime raytracing on the CPU.

* Move a sphere using either the arrow keys or `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`.
* Switch to the next sphere with `space` or `tab`.
* Toggle fullscreen with `f` or `f11`.
* Quit with `q` or `esc`.
* You can also move the current sphere with a joystick, then press a key to select the next one.

## Requirements

* SDL2 (`sdl2` and optionally `sdl2_image`, `sdl2_mixer`, `sdl2_ttf`, `sdl2_net` and `sdl2_sound`)
* OpenMP (`libomp`)
* CMake (`cmake`)
* GNU Make (`make`)
