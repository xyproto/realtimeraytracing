# Sphere Mover

An experiment with C++, SDL2 and OpenMP-based realtime raytracing.

* Move a sphere using either the arrow keys or `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`.
* Switch to the next sphere with `space` or `tab`.
* Toggle fullscreen with `f` or `f11`.
* Quit with `q` or `esc`.
* You can also move the current sphere with a joystick, then press a key to select the next one.
